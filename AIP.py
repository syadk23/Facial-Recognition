initialize cache with a default policy
initialize policy history counters to 0
initialize hit and miss counters to 0

for each cache access:
    if the access is a hit:
        increment hit counter
        update policy history counters for the hit policy
    else:
        increment miss counter
        determine the best policy to use based on the policy history counters
        set the cache policy to the best policy
        update policy history counters for the chosen policy
        evict the cache block using the chosen policy

calculate hit rate, miss rate, throughput, and time

print statistics (hit rate, miss rate, throughput, and time)
